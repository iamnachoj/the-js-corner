Whoa, what a ride this year has been in the programming realm! Back in January, I strutted into the coding scene with less than 5 months of experience, thinking I was the next coding prodigy. Spoiler alert: I laugh at that now.

Reality hit hard. Bugs, tasks I couldn't crack solo, uncomfortable moments admitting I needed helpâ€”welcome to the rollercoaster of learning. I get the imposter syndrome struggle, but guess what? I've transformed into a real junior developer from the chaotic newbie I was.

Angular was my jam until August 2023. Just when I thought I had it down, boom! NextJS project dropped on us, a whole new framework to conquer. Redux Toolkit is my current nemesis, but hey, I'm diving into it along with Tailwind, React Testing Library, and the intricate infrastructure of our new project.

Just had my Personal Development plan session. Goals? Gain React-Next.js mastery, ace Redux Toolkit, and level up my JavaScript game. Online courses, side projects, team collaborationâ€”bring it on!

2024, here I comeâ€”expecting victories, leveling up, and maintaining the hustle! ðŸ’»ðŸš€ #ProgrammingJourney #Goals #TechLife #2024Success
