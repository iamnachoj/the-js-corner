# Hoisting, Coercion, and More

JavaScript is an awesome language, but letâ€™s be realâ€”it has some weird quirks. If you've ever been surprised by JavaScript's behavior, you're not alone. Let's explore a few of the "weird parts" of JavaScript, including **hoisting, type coercion, and some other odd behaviors** that can trip up even experienced developers.

## 1. Hoisting: Variables That Seem to Magically Move

Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s way of moving function and variable declarations to the top of their scope. But **only the declarations are moved, not the assignments.**

### Example:
```js
console.log(name); // undefined
var name = "Alice";
console.log(name); // "Alice"
```

Why does this happen? Because JavaScript **hoists** the variable declaration (var name;) to the top, but not the assignment (name = "Alice"). So internally, the code runs like this:

```js
var name;
console.log(name); // undefined
name = "Alice";
console.log(name); // "Alice"
```

#### What about let and const?
Unlike var, variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but **stay in a "temporal dead zone"** until they are initialized.

```js
console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 30;
```

Lesson? Use let and const instead of var to avoid hoisting confusion.

## 2. Type Coercion: JavaScriptâ€™s Best Guess
JavaScript loves to convert types for you. Sometimes this is useful, other times it leads to **unexpected** results.

### Example:
```js
console.log(5 + "5"); // "55" (number + string = string)
console.log("5" - 2); // 3 (string is converted to number)
console.log(0 == false); // true (because 0 is "falsy")
console.log([] == 0); // true (empty array converts to "")
```

Why does this happen? JavaScript automatically converts types to try to make sense of what youâ€™re doing. This is called **type coercion**.

#### How to avoid coercion issues?
- **Use strict equality (===)** instead of loose equality (==).
- **Explicitly convert values** instead of relying on JavaScriptâ€™s guesses.

Example:
```js
console.log(Number("5") + 5); // 10
console.log(Boolean("")); // false
console.log([] === 0); // false (strict equality avoids type conversion)
```

## 3. Other Weird Behaviors

### **Truthy and Falsy Values**
Some values are automatically considered "truthy" or "falsy" in JavaScript. Check this out:

```js
if ("0") console.log("Truthy!"); // This runs, because "0" is a non-empty string
if (0) console.log("Falsy!"); // This does NOT run, because 0 is falsy
```

Values that are **falsy** in JavaScript:
- false
- 0
- "" (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN

Everything else is truthy, even "0" and "false" as strings!

### **Adding Arrays and Objects**
Ever tried adding arrays or objects?

```js
console.log([] + []); // "" (empty string)
console.log([] + {}); // "[object Object]"
console.log({} + []); // "[object Object]" (Weird behavior due to automatic type conversion)
```

### **Function Overloading Doesn't Work Like You Think**
Unlike other languages, JavaScript doesnâ€™t support function overloading in the usual way.

```js
function greet(name) {
console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

function greet() {
console.log("Hi there!");
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: "Hi there!" (the second function overwrites the first)
```

### **NaN is Not Equal to Itself**
NaN (Not-a-Number) is the only value in JavaScript that **is not equal to itself.**

```js
console.log(NaN === NaN); // false
```

If you need to check if a value is NaN, use Number.isNaN(value) instead.

```js
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN)); // true
```

## Conclusion
JavaScript has its quirks, but understanding them makes you a better developer. **Hoisting, type coercion, and truthy/falsy values** are just a few of the many things that can surprise you. The key is to always test your assumptions and write clear, explicit code.
